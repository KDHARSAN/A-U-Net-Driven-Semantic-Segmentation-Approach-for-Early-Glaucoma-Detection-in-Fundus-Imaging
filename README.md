# A-U-Net-Driven-Semantic-Segmentation-Approach-for-Early-Glaucoma-Detection-in-Fundus-Imaging
This project develops an automated glaucoma detection system using U-Net for optic disc and cup segmentation from 512×512 fundus images. Trained on 1,200 images with Dice–BCE loss, it achieved Dice scores of 0.96 and 0.92. CDR-based classification (≥0.6) produced 94.3% accuracy and 0.97 AUC.
